# ROCm Runtime MSI — Usage Guide

## System Requirements

|              |                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| OS           | Windows 11 / Windows Server 2019 or later |
| Architecture | x86-64                                    |
| Privileges   | Administrator                             |
| Disk space   | ~200 MB                                   |

## Install

The MSI has no graphical UI and is intended for scripted and enterprise
deployment. All `msiexec` commands must be run from an elevated prompt.

**Silent install (default location):**

```bat
msiexec /i amdrocm-runtime.msi /qn
```

**Silent install with a log file:**

```bat
msiexec /i amdrocm-runtime.msi /qn /l*v "%TEMP%\rocm-install.log"
```

**Silent install to a custom directory:**

```bat
msiexec /i amdrocm-runtime.msi /qn TARGETDIR="D:\ROCm\"
```

**Silent install with long-path support disabled:**

```bat
msiexec /i amdrocm-runtime.msi /qn ENABLE_LONG_PATHS=0
```

## What Gets Installed

| Item                         | Default location                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime DLLs and executables | `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\runtime-<version>\bin\` |
| Import libraries (`.lib`)    | `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\runtime-<version>\lib\` |
| System PATH entry            | `...\bin` appended to the machine-wide PATH        |
| Install-dir registry key     | `HKLM\Software\AMD\ROCm\<version>\InstallDir`      |

### Optional: Long Path Support

Passing `ENABLE_LONG_PATHS=1` additionally writes:

| Registry key                                       | Value              | Data        |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem` | `LongPathsEnabled` | `1` (DWORD) |

This lifts the 260-character `MAX_PATH` limit system-wide. Requires Windows 11
or Windows Server 2019 or later. A reboot is needed for the change to propagate to all running
processes; processes started after the installer exits pick it up immediately.

The installer checks whether `LongPathsEnabled` was already set to `1` before
installing. If it was already enabled (by the user or another installer), the
key is left untouched on uninstall. If the ROCm installer set it, it is removed
on uninstall.

## Upgrade

Install the new MSI directly — no manual uninstall required:

```bat
msiexec /i amdrocm-runtime-<new-version>.msi /qn
```

Installing an older version over a newer one is blocked. Uninstall the current
version first if a downgrade is needed.

## Uninstall

**Using the MSI file:**

```bat
msiexec /x amdrocm-runtime.msi /qn
```

**Using the product code (when the MSI file is unavailable):**

```bat
:: Find the product code
wmic product where "Name like '%ROCm%'" get Name,Version,IdentifyingNumber

:: Uninstall by product code
msiexec /x {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX} /qn
```

**Using Settings:** Apps > Installed apps > find the ROCm entry (e.g.
"AMD ROCm Runtime", or "AMD ROCm Core Runtime" for the core package) >
Uninstall.

Uninstall removes all installed files, the PATH entry, and all registry keys
written by the installer. Files created after installation are not removed.

## Troubleshooting

### PATH not updated

PATH changes apply to newly opened terminals only. Open a new prompt and check:

```bat
echo %PATH%
```

`...\AMD\ROCm\runtime-<version>\bin` should appear in the output.

### Installation fails

Capture a verbose log and check the last error:

```bat
msiexec /i amdrocm-runtime.msi /qn /l*v "%TEMP%\rocm-install.log"
findstr /i "error" "%TEMP%\rocm-install.log"
```

### Long path errors

Long-path support is enabled by default. If it was explicitly disabled, re-enable it:

```bat
msiexec /i amdrocm-runtime.msi /qn ENABLE_LONG_PATHS=1
```

Or set the registry key manually and reboot:

```bat
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" /v LongPathsEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

### Legacy DLL conflicts

Older ROCm installers placed DLLs such as `amdhip64_6.dll` directly into
`C:\Windows\System32\`, where they take precedence over the copies in Program
Files. The installer removes them automatically. If problems persist, check
manually:

```bat
dir C:\Windows\System32\amdhip64_*.dll
dir C:\Windows\System32\amd_comgr_*.dll
```

Delete any files found, then repair the installation:

```bat
msiexec /fvomus amdrocm-runtime.msi /qn
```
